This browser-based document describes the [libE57Format](https://github.com/asmaloney/libE57Format) API (Application Programmer Interface), which is a collection of functions that help a C++ programmer read and write ASTM E57 format files. The API acts as a documented software connector between an application (above the interface) and an implementation of the API.

This documentation was generated from the comments in the code that existed in the reference implementation ([see Fork](#fork)). These docs are probably out of date and may not be complete, so consider them a starting point. Please submit any updates and fixes (for [these docs](https://github.com/asmaloney/libE57Format-docs/issues) or [in the code](https://github.com/asmaloney/libE57Format/issues)) so they may be improved over time.

These pages document the public interface for libE57Format. Internal documentation may be generated using Doxygen by removing the `EXCLUDE` and `EXCLUDE_PATTERNS` settings from the Doxyfile and re-running the doc generation.
